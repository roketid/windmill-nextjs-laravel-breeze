# Windmill with Laravel Breeze as Backend API

## Introduction

This repository is an implementing of the [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits) application / authentication starter kit frontend in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). All of the authentication boilerplate is already written for you - powered by [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum), allowing you to quickly begin pairing your beautiful Next.js frontend with a powerful Laravel backend.

## Official Documentation

### Installation

First, create a Next.js compatible Laravel backend by installing Laravel Breeze into a [fresh Laravel application](https://laravel.com/docs/installation) and installing Breeze's API scaffolding:

```bash
# Create the Laravel application...
laravel new next-backend

cd next-backend

# Install Breeze and dependencies...
composer require laravel/breeze

php artisan breeze:install api
```

Next,
- Ensure that your application's `APP_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` environment variables are set to `http://localhost:8000` and `http://localhost:3000/example`, respectively.

- In `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php`, update : `public const HOME = '/';`

- In `app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php`, update :
```php
protected function redirectTo($request)
{
    if (! $request->expectsJson()) {
        return config('app.frontend_url').'/login?next_to='.urlencode($request->url());
    }
}
``` 

- In `app/Http/Middleware/RedirectIfAuthenticated.php`, update :
```php
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next, ...$guards)
{
    $guards = empty($guards) ? [null] : $guards;

    foreach ($guards as $guard) {
        if (Auth::guard($guard)->check()) {
            return redirect(config('app.frontend_url').RouteServiceProvider::HOME);
        }
    }

    return $next($request);
}
```

- In `config/cors.php`, update :
```php
<?php

$frontedUrl = env('FRONTEND_URL', '*');

if ($frontedUrl !== '*') {
    $parsed = parse_url($frontedUrl);
    $frontedUrl = sprintf(
        '%s://%s%s',
        $parsed['scheme'],
        $parsed['host'],
        isset($parsed['port']) ? ':' . $parsed['port'] : ''
    );
}

return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Here you may configure your settings for cross-origin resource sharing
    | or "CORS". This determines what cross-origin operations may execute
    | in web browsers. You are free to adjust these settings as needed.

    |
    */

    'paths' => ['*'],

    'allowed_methods' => ['*'],

    'allowed_origins' => [$frontedUrl],

    'allowed_origins_patterns' => [],

    'allowed_headers' => ['*'],

    'exposed_headers' => [],

    'max_age' => 0,

    'supports_credentials' => true,

];

```


After defining the appropriate environment variables and update several codes above, you may serve the Laravel application using the `serve` Artisan command:

```bash
# Serve the application...
php artisan serve
```

Next, clone this repository and install its dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`. Then, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and supply the URL of your backend:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Finally, run the application via `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`:

```
yarn dev

# or

npm run dev
```

> Note: Currently, we recommend using `localhost` during local development of your backend and frontend to avoid CORS "Same-Origin" issues.

### Authentication Hook

This Next.js application contains a custom `useAuth` React hook, designed to abstract all authentication logic away from your pages. In addition, the hook can be used to access the currently authenticated user:

```js
const ExamplePage = () => {
    const { logout, user } = useAuth({ middleware: 'auth' })

    return (
        <>
            <p>{user?.name}</p>

            <button onClick={logout}>Sign out</button>
        </>
    )
}

export default ExamplePage
```

> Note: You will need to use [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) (`user?.name` instead of `user.name`) when accessing properties on the user object to account for Next.js's initial server-side render.

See the [Original Project by @estevanmaito](https://github.com/estevanmaito/windmill-dashboard-react/)

- [NextJS TailwindCSS 3 and Typescript](https://wgithub.com/roketid/indmill-dashboard-nextjs-typescript)


This is not a template. This is a complete application, built on top of React, with all tiny details taken care of so you just need to bring the data to feed it.

Accessibility is a priority in my projects and I think it should be in yours too, so this was developed listening to real screen readers, focus traps and keyboard navigation are available everywhere.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- ðŸ¦® Throughly accessible (developed using screen readers)
- ðŸŒ— Dark theme enabled (load even different images based on theme)
- ðŸ§© Multiple (custom) components
- âš¡ Code splitting
- Tailwind CSS
- [Windmill React UI Documentation](https://windmillui.com/react-ui)
- Heroicons
- Chart.js

## ðŸ“š Docs

### General components

Windmill Dashboard React is built on top of [Windmill React UI](https://github.com/roketid/windmill-react-ui). 

See [Windmill React UI Documentation](https://windmillui.com/react-ui)

### Example Boilerplate

All components and containers are saved in folder [example](example)

### Routing

Change default redirecting when hit the `/` or `home` in file [next.config.js](next.config.js)
```js
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/',
        destination: '/example/login',
        permanent: false,
      },
    ]
  }
```

#### Sidebar routes

To configure sidebar menus, see file ([routes/sidebar.tsx](routes/sidebar.tsx)).

These are the routes that will show in the sidebar. They expect three properties:

- `path`: the destination;
- `name`: the name to be shown;
- `icon`: an icon to illustrate the item

Item that are used as dropdowns, like the Pages option, don't need a `path`, but expect a `routes` array of objects with `path` and `name`:

```js
// sidebar.js
{
  path: '/example/tables',
  icon: 'TablesIcon',
  name: 'Tables',
},
{
  icon: 'PagesIcon', // <-- this is used as a submenu, so no path
  name: 'Pages',
  routes: [
    // submenu
    {
      path: '/example/login',
      name: 'Login', // <-- these don't have icons
    },
    {
      path: '/example/create-account',
      name: 'Create account',
    },
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies :
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

then, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
